# vault-plugin-auth-u2f
This is a non official plugin for HashiCorp Vault that uses a FIDO U2F enabled device as way to authenticate a human.

By requiring something you know, a PIN with something you have, the physical token.

It works by assigning a role to a device when an administrator registers it.

It currently support the web browser implementation of the U2F protocol from Google https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/blob/master/u2f-gae-demo/war/js/u2f-api.js

It uses the u2f for Go library by Ryan Kurte: https://github.com/ryankurte/go-u2f


# Roles

Roles must be created to associate a set of policies to a token created for a device:

```
$ vault write auth/u2f/roles/my-role token_policies="polA,polB"
```
# Registrations

Registration of new devices is done by a POST to the endpoint `auth/<u2f>/registerRequest/<mydevice>` with the payload of `role_name: <my-role>` as json.

`<mydevice>` Is meant to be the friendly name given to the physical token when an administrator "registers" it in Vault.

Internally its the unique ID that will be used as a key to save all the data for future authentication.

There is no expected format, only that its in simple ascii and url safe.

This ID will have to be known by the person to be authenticated, could be an email or a PIN.

Finishing with another POST to `auth/<u2f>/registerResponse` with a payload of the protocol data signed by the device when the user presses the physical button.

See the demo in the directory u2f-frontend.

These endpoints should be protected for writting and only given access to admistrators.

# Authentication
This is done via the endpoints `auth/<u2f>/signRequest` and `auth/<u2f>/signResponse` with appropiate protocol data as payload.

# Demo

* In the directory u2f-frontend you will find a shell script that will start Vault in dev mode and load the plugin:
``` 
$ make 
$ cd u2f-frontend
$ ./start_vault.sh
+ set +e
++ pidof vault
+ kill -TERM 236661
+ export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
+ VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
+ unset VAULT_TOKEN
+ sleep 3s
+ /usr/local/bin/vault server -dev -dev-listen-address=0.0.0.0:8200 -dev-root-token-id=root -dev-plugin-dir=../plugins -log-level=trace
+ vault auth enable u2f
Success! Enabled u2f auth method at: u2f/
+ sleep 1s
+ vault write auth/u2f/roles/my-role token_policies=polA,polB
Success! Data written to: auth/u2f/roles/my-role
+ sleep 1s
+ vault read auth/u2f/roles/my-role
Key                        Value
---                        -----
token_bound_cidrs          []
token_explicit_max_ttl     0s
token_max_ttl              0s
token_no_default_policy    false
token_num_uses             0
token_period               0s
token_policies             [polA polB]
token_ttl                  0s
token_type                 default
```

This creates a role that assigns two policies to any device that is registered with it.

* Go to a browser to https://localhost:3483
![](u2f-frontend/u2f-demo.png)

* Click in Register token and press the button in your device
* Click in Authenticate and press the button in your device

The token that you receive will have the policies attached that your role was assigned at the begining:
